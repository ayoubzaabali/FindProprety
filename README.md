# üê≥ Docker + Spring/Spring boot +  Angular 16 + Nginx + Mariadb

![stack](https://github.com/ayoubzaabali/FindProprety/assets/78790570/58187b1b-616a-429e-b04c-38f01717a6ee)



# Description 

A complete stack for running Spring/Spring boot & Angular 16 App into Docker containers using the docker-compose tool, with a proxy Nginx between front and back (connected to the DB container).

# List of  containers:

- `real_estate_fe`, the one that runs the build of Angular APP in a container with Nginx.
  
- `backend`, this container is running the business logic using spring JDBC and SQL queries & rest API, this container contains 3 modules (business, modules, rest)
  
- `mariadb` storing the MariaDB database Tables.
  
- `phpmyadmin` handles the administration of MariaDB.

### The application has 3 maven modules :

- `real-estate-modules`: contains the entities of the app, this part is developed only using Spring Framework
  
- `real-estate-business`: contains the business logic of the app, it imports the code of the 'real-estate-modules' module so we can use all the entities here, this part is also developed only using Spring Framework
  
- `real-estate-rest`: contains the REST API endpoints and is connected directly to the other maven modules(business,modules), this part is developed using Spring Boot / Spring MVC

# Testing

0. You need **docker** and **docker-compose** where to launch this stack if you do not have it...[ [INSTALL DOCKER ENGINE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

1. Clone this rep.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ayoubzaabali/FindProprety
   ```

2. To check that everything runs correctly Run :
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```  

3. If there are no errors, stop (`ctrl+C`) and delete containers with :
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```  
  This will run the container logs in the background.
   

8. To check that everything is running correctly in the background, run:
   ```
   docker-compose ps -a
   ```
   and you will see the running containers.
